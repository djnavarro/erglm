# erglm 0.1.0

Initial CRAN release.

* Model fitting and prediction for exposure-response models based on
  `glm()` (`erglm_model()`, `erglm_predict()`), supporting arbitrary
  `glm()` families; binomial, poisson, gaussian, and gamma are tested
  and officially supported end to end (fitting, prediction, SCM
  significance testing, and simulation).
* Stepwise covariate modelling (`erglm_scm_forward()`,
  `erglm_scm_backward()`, `erglm_scm_history()`), built on the
  single-term `erglm_add_term()`/`erglm_remove_term()` helpers.
* Simulation support (`erglm_fun()`, `simulate.erglm_model()`) for
  drawing replicate responses from a fitted model, with sampled
  coefficients and both expected and simulated response columns.
* Interoperability with the companion
  [erplots](https://github.com/djnavarro/erplots) package via
  `er_predict()`/`er_simulate()`/`er_summary()` methods, registered
  lazily so erglm has no hard dependency on erplots or on any plotting
  package.
* `erglm_link()`/`erglm_invlink()`, discoverable wrappers around a
  fitted model's link and inverse-link functions.
* An example dataset, `erglm_data`, with binary, count, and
  continuous/right-skewed continuous response columns for
  demonstrating each supported family.
